# Sectrics - Truss Analysis Calculator
The Sectrics application is a Truss Analysis Calculator made to find the forces in each member, being tensile or compressive using the Finite Element Method. This program was part of the HSC course in Australia as part of my major project, as such this program is NOT intended to be used for real life structural analysis and therefore we take no responsibility for harm from the misuse/misfunctioning of this program.
